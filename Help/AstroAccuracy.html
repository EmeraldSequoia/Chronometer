<center><h2>Accuracy of the<br>Astronomical Algorithms</h2></center>

<h3>General rule</h3>
As a general rule, you can assume that all of the astronomical
displays within EMERALD_PRODUCT are at least as accurate as the
precision with which you can read the display, from about 4000 BCE to
about 2800 CE.
<span class='Chronometer'>
For example, the
azimuth displays on Haleakala can be read approximately to the nearest
degree, and there is far more accuracy in the data than that.
</span>
<p>
<span class='Chronometer'>
Similarly, the
</span>
<span class='GenevaOnly'>
For example, the
</span>
rise and set dials, which can be read to the nearest
minute, are at least that accurate.  But note of course that they are only valid
if the rise or set point on the horizon is at exactly the same level
as you are; if the Sun is setting behind a hill above you, for example, it will
set much earlier than the time indicated.
<p>
The displays depend heavily on having the correct time and location.
If you have NTP synchronization and Location Services turned on,
the correct time zone set in the iPhone's Settings app, and have green
lights at the top of the display, you can presume that everything you
are looking at is as accurate as you can read it.  In general, those green lights
mean you have about a kilometer (half a mile) of accuracy and are within a
half second of the correct time.
<h3>Specifics</h3>
The algorithms employed in EMERALD_PRODUCT
are very high-precision series calculations originally developed by
astronomers at the Bureau des Longitudes in Paris in the 1980s and
1990s.  They are particularly well-suited for the iPhone because the
data tables they are based on can fit in about 500 kilobytes of memory
(this includes data for most planets for the same period), and yet
still produce accuracy of less than 1/100 of a degree for times within
500 years of the present.  No Internet connection is required for any
astronomical calculation.
<p>
Specifically, the tables employed are from <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0943396336/billarnett'>Lunar Tables and Programs
from 4000 B.C. to A.D. 8000<img src="extlink.png"></a>, by Michelle Chapront-Touz&eacute; & Jean
Chapront, copyright 1991, and
<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0943396085/billarnett'>Planetary Programs and Tables from -4000 to +2800<img src="extlink.png"></a>, by Pierre
Bretagnon & Jean-Louis Simon, copyright 1986, both published by
Willmann-Bell, Inc. (the latter includes the Sun motion tables).
<p>
The algorithms presented in those books were ported to C for use in the
iPhone development environment, and local caches were developed to
avoid recalculation of common quantities.  The time conversions in
those books have been superceded by more accurate ones, described below.
<p>
As a side note, the iPhone is a potent floating-point calculating
machine; every time you move the Sun or Moon hand on Mauna Kea a
little bit, over a thousand double-precision sines and cosines are
calculated, whose arguments are themselves each polynomial expressions
with several terms, and it all gets done in much less than a tenth of
a second.  Early in their careers the authors of EMERALD_PRODUCT
used machines that filled whole rooms with less horsepower than the
iPhone you're holding in your hand.
<p>
The RA display on Geneva displays the RA "of date", meaning the RA
applied from the equniox current on the given date.  This means that
the Local Sidereal Time (per its definition) also displays the
rotation from the equinox, and not from the equinox of J2000.  It also
means that the Sun, Moon, and lunar nodal points' RA "of date" may be
read from that dial.  The constellations are displayed in the exact
orientation found in J2000, but rotated according to the precession to
match their locations at the displayed time.  The P03 formulae for
general precession are used.
<p>
<div display='inline' class='Chronometer'>
In contrast, on Mauna Kea, the RA display is fixed in the zodiac
dial to be the J2000 RA numbers of the constellations, and so on that
dial may be read the J2000 RA of the Sun and Moon.  The local sidereal
time may thus be read from the front of MK only in centuries close to
J2000; at other times, the more accurate LST display on the back of Mauna
Kea may be used.

<h3>Historical data</h3>
As mentioned, you can use EMERALD_PRODUCT
to display astronomical information going back to 4000 B.C.  However,
it is important to understand that the time scale going back that far
is subject to considerable uncertainty, due to uncertainties in the
exact rotational speed of the Earth in the past.
<p>
What that means in
practice is that the astronomical events happened as shown, but the
time of day may not be the exact time that they happened.  You can
find a discussion of the various time scales involved, notably
Ephemeris Time, or Terrestrial Dynamic Time, and Universal Time, in
many places on the web.
<p>
And, of course, the dates of events  depend on which calendar is used.
EMERALD_PRODUCT uses the Gregorian calendar for future dates and for past dates back to 1582,
 and the Julian calendar from 1 BCE to 1582 CE.
  Prior to 1 BCE EMERALD_PRODUCT uses a proleptic Julian calendar, with leap years
 on 1BCE, 5BCE, etc, back every four years.
  Until very recently calendar representations around the world have varied widely, 
so using EMERALD_PRODUCT for historical dates requires an advanced knowledge
 of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology">Chronology<img src="extlink.png"></a>.
<p>
EMERALD_PRODUCT always displays UTC, and uses that as the starting
point for its calculations, converting to Terrestrial Dynamic Time (TDT)
 using the polynomial expressions suggested by Fred Espenak
at <a href='http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/deltatpoly2004.html'>this
NASA site<img src="extlink.png"></a> based on the data in Morrison & Stephenson, 2004.
