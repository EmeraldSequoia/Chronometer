Emerald Chronometer test plan for each release:

1.  Startup performance: no regression on Miami or Terra

2.  Frame rate performance: no regression on Miami and Terra
    - Use PERFORMANCE_TEST ifdef in CAD to test -- bring watch up, quit, then restart and don't touch anything -- test will run automatically after 30 seconds

3.  Verify rise/set times at high latitudes (for easiest identification of bugs) ref:  http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/data-services/mrst-us
     - Sun
     - Moon
     - One or two planets, on Miami's front

4.  Alarms
    - Test Thebes
    - Test Istanbul
    - Test when locked
    - Switch away from the alarm watch just before the alarm fires to see that it switches back without incident
    - See that an alarm fires OK when in Help, Options, Location options, Switcher, Grid
    - Test in background (should put up local notification)
    - Test that Istanbul alarm does *not* fire when not enabled (no note), ditto Thebes
    - Test that Istanbul alarm does *not* put up LocalNotification when not enabled (no note), ditto Thebes
    - Test after long period of locked (at least one hour)
    - Test on all devices (OS 3.x-only devices like original iPhone, OS4-but-no-multitasking like 3G, full OS4 like 3GS and following, Retina, iPad)
    - Test that alarms respect user setting of Ring/Vibrate in both positions of Ring/Silent switch
    - Turn on TS_TEST in TSTime.m to verify that sync changes have no effect on Thebes alarms (Istanbul's will properly follow changing "ntp" time)
      - while this switch is on, test Olympia to ensure smooth tracking through the skew swings

5.  Verify disable-auto-lock switch working in each configuration (battery, plugged in)

        message and eventually the watch
    - Verify can switch to editor
