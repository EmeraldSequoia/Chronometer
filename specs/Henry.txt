As of December 2017, the right way to build the atlases (aka archives) is:

- You will need a nonstandard Perl module.  Fortunately this is easy to install:

cpan
cpan> install File::Copy::Recursive

You need to run a command server:
- In a terminal window cd'd to the top level of the sandbox, invoke scripts/commandServer.pl and leave it running while Henry runs below

- Shut down any apps running in any simulators

- scripts/clearArchives.pl (deletes *ALL* (Henry) archive directories in all simulator apps)

- run ChronometerWithHenry in the simulator, iPhone 5s, iOS 11.4
- run ChronometerWithHenryHD in the simulator, iPhone 5s, iOS 11.4  (note: NOT iPad)

- scripts/extractArchives.pl to extract the archives from the simulator app directory.
