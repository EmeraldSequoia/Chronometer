Renaming a watch is straightforward if the following steps are followed precisely.

Note that it is not possible to commit all of the changes at once without creating an svn conflict.

<FromWatch>  is the old name
  <ToWatch>  is the new name

1.  If there is an old watch already named <ToWatch>, get it out of the way first:
    a.  cd Watches/Builtin
    b.  svn rename <ToWatch> Old<ToWatch>
    c.  svn commit -m "Rename <ToWatch> to Old<ToWatch> in preparation for rename of <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>" <ToWatch> Old<ToWatch>
    d.  cd ../../Help
    e.  svn rename <ToWatch> Old<ToWatch>
    f.  svn commit -m "Rename <ToWatch> to Old<ToWatch> in preparation for rename of <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>" <ToWatch> Old<ToWatch>
    g.  cd ..

2.  Rename the Help and Watches directories (but do *not* make any changes to files within those directories):
    a.  cd Watches/Builtin
    b.  svn rename <FromWatch> <ToWatch>
    c.  svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>
[Note: At this point the svn archive will be in a non-buildable state, until the remainder of the steps are done.  But it is necessary
 to do this here to avoid svn conflicts later.]
    d.  cd ../../Help
    e.  svn rename <FromWatch> <ToWatch>
    f.  svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>
    g.  cd ..
    h.  scripts/clearArchives.pl
[Note: do the above, but do it *before* the svn revert.]
    i.  svn revert -R archive
    j.  cd archive    
    k.  svn rename <FromWatch> <ToWatch>
    l.  svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>
    m.  cd ..

3.  Rename the files *inside* the Help and Watches directories:
    a.  cd Watches/Builtin/<ToWatch>
    b.  svn rename <FromWatch>.xml <ToWatch>.xml
    c.  svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>
    d.  cd ../../../Help/<ToWatch>
    e.  svn rename <FromWatch>.html <ToWatch>.html
    f.  svn rename <FromWatch>-icon-f.png <ToWatch>-icon-f.png
    g.  svn rename <FromWatch>-icon-b.png <ToWatch>-icon-b.png
    h.  svn rename <FromWatch>-icon-n.png <ToWatch>-icon-n.png
    i.  svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>
    j.  cd ../..

3.  Find all of the places that refer to the watch name:

find . -name .svn -prune -o -name locationData -prune -o -name build -prune -o -exec grep -n Auckland {} /dev/null \; | grep -v Help/FullVersion.txt

4.  Edit the files found by the grep above.  Be careful about references to timezones and city defaults that should not change.

<manual edit>

5.  Commit the remaining changes:

svn commit -m "Rename <FromWatch> to <ToWatch>

Note:  Before updating, other users (and other sandboxes) should do the following:

scripts/superClean.pl
scripts/clearArchives.pl
svn revert -R archive
