EOT for day is simple: Find the RA of the Sun at noon UT on the given
day.  The time at which that RA crosses the meridian (at Greenwich) is
given by the GMSiT that is equal to that RA (since sidereal time tells
which RA is at the meridian).  Thus we take the RA, treat it as a
GMSiT, and convert to UT; the answer will be close to, but not
exactly, noon UT, and the difference is the EOT at noon UT.

EOT at some other time is a bit trickier.  But the same idea can
apply.  For any given UT within a day, there is some longitude for
which the mean Sun crosses the meridian at that time (analogous to the
mean Sun crossing the meridian at Greenwich at noon UT).  So we can
treat the RA as the Local Actual Sidereal Time *for that longitude*,
convert to Greenwich Actual Sidereal Time, and then convert again as
before to UT.

To find the magic longitude under the mean Sun, we simply take the
hours-since-noon and convert to a longitude as an offset from
Greenwich.
