## THE EXTENSION DOWNLOADER, LIKE ECSTORE, WAS NEVER RELEASED.
# They were intended to allow in-app purchasing of higher-definition atlases.

There are several components to the ECStore / extension download system:

1.  ECStore is an Objective-C class that interfaces with the Apple Store Kit (SK*) API.
  It also starts a connection with the ES CGI server (for convenience).  It does not handle
  the return from the connection, other than to pass through all bytes to the following class.

2.  ECStoreConnectionReader is responsible for reading the bytes coming back on the connection
  from the ES CGI server.

3.  On the ES website, in cgi-bin, is downloadExtension.pl.  That routine confirms the
  transaction receipt with Apple's server, and if it's ok, sends back a set of files.

4.  In the sandbox, scripts/extractZ1Archives.pl extracts the archives to be downloaded from
  the archive directory in the sandbox, and copies them to a separate area, from which they
  should be uploaded to http://emeraldsequoia.com/extensions (a password-controlled area).

Each extensions is identified by its product id, of the form
com.emeraldsequoia.Chronometer.<id>, and its archive version number,
of the form 3.3_r5967.  This is necessary to avoid using the wrong
archives with the a given executable.  The version number is derived
from the Info.plist and by examining the most recent checkin in the
archive directory.  If the archive directory has uncommitted
modifications, the form will include the date of the most recent
uncommitted modification, so that every time the archive directory is
modified, the implied version of the archives is incremented.  This version
will look like 3.3_r5967M_2010.06.27-15.44.53

Extensions, once downloaded and received by ECStoreConnectionReader, are placed in the
application sandbox Documents area, by version number.  It is illegal to use these extension
files until the downloader has downloaded the complete product id; this is flagged by setting
an appropriate defaults setting for the combination productID-version, as in
  extensionComplete-<productID>-<version>  true

It is possible to restart a connection in the middle, both at a file
level and within a file.  This is to make it easier for someone to do
a little bit at a time, especially on pre-OS4 devices.
